let youAndYourBaby1:[String]! = ["youAndYourBaby1", "There are many reasons why your baby may have been born preterm. Your early delivery may have been planned in advance, or it might have been unexpected.\nThe most common reasons for a spontaneous preterm birth are:", "An infection within the uterus or vagina (such as a urinary tract infection)", "There is evidence to show that the presence of certain bacteria in the urine, even if there are no signs of infection, can cause premature labour. It is now recommended that all women have their urine tested for bacteria early in pregnancy. Treating the infection may reduce the risk of premature labour. The vagina can also contain bacteria, and this may contribute to a premature birth.", "A weakness in the neck of the womb (often called ‘cervical incompetence’)", "This is when the muscles that close the neck of the womb (cervix) are weak. The weight of the baby may cause the cervix to open in the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy. You may be offered a stitch called a Shirodkar suture which is tied round the cervix to try to prevent it from opening too early in pregnancy. This kind of stitch can sometimes help women who have had repeated miscarriages because of a relatively weak cervix. The stitch is usually inserted at 14 weeks and removed at 37 weeks. It can also be put around the cervix in the early stages of pregnancy to help keep it closed.", "The premature rupture of membranes", "This is when the waters break before 37 weeks’ gestation. It can be caused by a bacterial infection. Most women go into spontaneous labour within 24 to 48 hours of their waters breaking.\nThe most common reasons for a planned preterm birth are:", "Multiple births", "Women go into premature labour in nearly half of twin pregnancies – far more often than women carrying only one baby. Overall, about one-third of women pregnant with twins who go into premature labour end up delivering early.", "Pre-eclampsia", "This is a disorder that only occurs during pregnancy and after pregnancy, affecting about 8-10% of all pregnancies. It affects both the mother and the unborn baby and is a rapidly progressive condition characterised by high blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine. Typically, pre-eclampsia occurs after 20 weeks’ gestation in middle to late pregnancy, although it can occur earlier.", "Medical conditions detected in the womb", "During your pregnancy you will have had several tests and procedures to ensure your baby is growing well without any complications. However, in some instances, a condition or complication may have been detected. For many reasons an early birth would have been planned and your baby admitted to a neonatal unit for their ongoing care and needs."]

let youAndYourBaby2:[String]! = ["youAndYourBaby2", "The most common reasons why your baby may have been admitted into special care include:", "Breathing support", "Your baby may require breathing support due to meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). This happens most often in babies born at or near full term. During delivery, sometimes a baby inhales a mixture of amniotic fluid and meconium (the baby’s first faeces or poo). This is sticky, thick and dark green. The baby’s windpipe is cleared as much as possible to clean up the meconium and the doctor will continue to try and clear the airway until there’s no meconium in the suctioned fluids.", "Jaundice ", "Jaundice is a common condition in new-born babies. It is caused by a build-up of a normal chemical in the blood called bilirubin. It causes yellowing in the skin and the whites of the eyes, usually on the second to fifth day after birth. Jaundice is a very treatable condition and the level of bilirubin will be measured using a special hand-held device placed briefly on the skin or by a blood test. Depending on the levels, staff on the unit may check your baby’s fluid intake is correct and later on may use light therapy. This helps to break down the bilirubin, which is then passed out of your baby’s urine. If jaundice continues, then further tests will be necessary and other treatment may need to be considered.", "Infections", "If your baby has caught an infection, they may receive support to help with breathing, in addition to antibiotics to help fight the illness. Preterm and low weight babies have a reduced ability to fight infection and this is a common problem that needs treatment. Sometimes infections are caused by germs collecting on long lines, which may need to be removed, or on ventilation tubing in the windpipe. More information on infections can be found here", "Patent ductus or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)", "Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common heart condition in babies. The ductus arteriosus is a small blood vessel that is normally present just outside a baby’s heart when they are in the womb.\nThe ductus (duct) connects the two main blood vessels leaving the heart (called the aorta and pulmonary artery). The duct allows the blood to ‘bypass’ the lungs, as they are not needed when the baby is in the womb.\nNormally after the birth, the lungs fill with air, and blood flows to the lungs. The duct is then not needed, and usually closes over the first few days of life. In some babies, the duct does not close properly. If the duct remains open, it is called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).\nIf the duct is large and causing problems for your baby, treatment may be started to encourage the duct to close. Starting treatment for a large duct in the first few days of life may help prevent problems later. Your baby’s doctor will talk to you about this.", "Treatment options", "Medication - The medications commonly used for PDA are called indomentacin and ibuprofen. They work best if given before two weeks of age. Usually, they are given into a vein. Doctors usually scan the baby’s heart again during the treatment to see if the medication is working.\nSurgery - If the ductus arteriosus remains open, and is causing your baby problems, the doctors may recommend a small operation to close the duct. Not all PDAs need surgery. Given time, some will close on their own, and your baby’s doctor will talk to you about whether your baby would benefit from an operation.", "What is sepsis?", "Sepsis happens when the body’s normal reaction to inflammation or a bacterial infection goes into overdrive. The bacteria create a toxin that causes widespread inflammation and rapid changes in the baby’s body temperature, blood pressure, in the lungs and other organs. Premature babies receiving neonatal intensive care are particularly susceptible to sepsis. This is because their immune systems are less developed.  These babies can also get infections through catheters, ventilation tubes and long-term intravenous lines. ", "Sepsis symptoms", "Symptoms of sepsis can be difficult to detect in babies. Several tests may be ordered to confirm diagnosis, including blood tests and blood cultures (to check whether bacteria are present in the blood), urine tests, X-rays and lumbar puncture.", "Sepsis treatment", "Doctors will often treat the symptoms of sepsis with antibiotics given intravenously (through a tube or intravenous line) before diagnosis has been confirmed. Antibiotics commonly used to treat sepsis include benzylpenicillin, gentamicin and flucloxacillin.", "Brain haemorrhage", "The tiny vessels that are found in abundance in some areas of a developing baby’s brain can sometimes rupture, causing bleeding.  These small haemorrhages appear to cause no long-term problems.\nLarger bleeds can occasionally occur, and doctors caring for your baby will monitor this by carrying out regular ultrasound scans. These larger bleeds may limit blood flow to certain areas of the brain. This means that those areas might  not receive enough oxygen.  Sometimes the flow of fluid from the brain to the spinal cord becomes blocked by the clots formed by the blood and the cells in this area then die and a small fluid-filled pocket forms there instead. Exactly how this might affect your baby will depend on where this ‘cyst’ is located. The doctors will explain what is happening and what this might mean for your baby.", "What is Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)", "Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a lack of oxygen and/or blood flow getting to your baby from the placenta during the birthing process. This is also sometimes referred to as 'asphyxia' or 'birth asphyxia'. HIE can affect all of your baby's organs: the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, and particularly the brain. It is not always possible to know what causes HIE, but we do know that a lack of oxygen can lead to brain injury, which can be mild, moderate or severe.", "HIE symptoms", "Your baby may be displaying symptoms which can include: being hyper-alert, irritable, eye-rolling and having abnormal movements (fits). Your baby may also have a reduced level of awareness.", "HIE treatment", "If your baby has been identified as having HIE, their treatment will depend on what level of symptoms they have. If they have moderate to severe HIE, they are likely to receive a treatment known as mild hypothermia or cooling. This is when a baby’s temperature is lowered, to limit the extent of brain injury associated with HIE.\nTreatment for HIE involves placing your baby on a special cooling mattress or wrapping them in a cooling wrap; the mattress or wrap is filled with fluid that can be cooled or warmed according to your baby’s needs. Your baby’s temperature will be monitored closely to ensure that it stays at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees."]
let youAndYourBaby3:[String]! = ["youAndYourBaby3", "For many parents, having a premature or sick baby is very stressful and frightening. You may be feeling that your world has just been turned upside down.\nIt is completely understandable to be feeling like this. It is important to remember that it is not your fault that your baby is in special care. You may have many questions about your baby’s care or you may be confused about the treatment they are receiving. You can always ask your baby’s doctors or nurses anything that is on your mind and they will try to give you as much information about your baby’s care and wellbeing as possible.\nMost new parents put their own needs second. It is hard to juggle running your home, work and visits to the hospital. But it is really important to look after yourself so that you can keep going. Look after the basics, like eating well and getting enough sleep. Try to talk about about how you are feeling to someone who understands.", "Later on", "While your baby was in the unit, you will have used a lot of energy just to keep going and stay strong. When you bring your baby home, the full impact of what has been happening over the last few weeks or months may suddenly catch up with you. You may feel very tearful or simply exhausted as your body starts to relax.\nDifferent members of the family will have experienced the situation in very different ways too, so you will all have to adjust to the new situation, particularly if there are other children in the family.\nThe weeks leading up to your baby’s first birthday can also be an emotional time for some parents. Memories of your baby’s birth – particularly if it was very traumatic – may come rushing back and take you by surprise. All these feelings are perfectly normal and understandable.\nIf you feel overwhelmed, there are many people who can help. Talk to your GP or health visitor, who will be able to tell you how to access counselling if you feel you need it. Bliss also offers a range of services to provide support to families at this time, you can find out more information in our how Bliss can help section.", "Talking to your other children", "If you already have other children, you may want to explain to them what is happening. The way they react will depend on how old they are, their personality, and how you are coping yourself.\nYounger children might be confused and wonder why their parents are away so much and are so stressed and tired. Older kids might be worried about the baby. There’s a lot you can do to help your other children cope:\n• Understand their feelings – Children often blame themselves when things go wrong, so they might feel guilty. Reassure them it’s not their fault. Make sure they know it’s OK to feel angry too. Children might not show their feelings in a straightforward way. Some might go quiet, while others might start misbehaving. They might go back to more babyish behaviour themselves, because they feel insecure.\n• Tell them what’s happening – It’s good to explain things honestly, but in a simple way that they can understand. Tell them what is wrong with the baby and what might happen. Worrying because things have not been explained to them can be worse for children than knowing all the facts.\n• Spend time with them – Be with your other children as much as you can and keep up their normal routines whenever possible. You can protect certain times that are just for them, like bedtime or going out to do something special once a month. If your partner can be there too, it’s good to spend time together as a family.\n• Help them get closer to the baby – They can send things to the hospital, like a cuddly toy or a picture they have drawn. You can bring back photos of the baby. When it’s time for older children to visit the baby in hospital, try to tell them what to expect ahead of time, and explain that all the equipment is there to help the baby get better and stronger.\n• Let others help – Make sure you have arrangements in place for someone to stay with the children if there is an emergency. Maybe other family members or friends can spend time with them, doing something fun. This will also help you feel less stressed and more able to focus on your baby in the unit.", "Other family and friends", "Having a baby in neonatal care can also be a difficult time for other family members and friends too. Grandparents, aunties and uncles, or friends of the family are often keen to support the baby’s parents whilst dealing with their own emotions about the situation. It can be difficult to know how to support the baby’s parents at this time and what support is also available for you as family and friends.\nBliss is here to provide support to the wider family and friends as well as the baby’s parents. We offer a range of support services, including a Family Services Helpline, message board and many useful publications. You can find out more information about these services in the next section How Bliss can help\nIt can be a challenging time when you know a loved one in special care and this can be especially tough if you’re not able to have your questions answered or get information on their condition. You may find it helpful to call our Family Services Helpline. We can talk through with you what it’s like on a neonatal unit and answer any general questions you have about what’s likely to be happening.\nSome parents can find it difficult to update those close to them on their baby’s condition, and can find it overwhelming if lots of people are asking them how their baby is. They might find it easier to have one contact person who they can update, and for this person to share the information with the rest of the family and close friends.  Offering to do this can mean one less thing for the parents to think about, and can help keep concerned family members updated about the baby’s condition. It can also help you to feel like you are doing something to help.\nYou may find it useful to speak to the baby’s parents and offer to help them in other ways. Sorting out day-to-day tasks such as food shopping, washing or picking up other children from school can really ease the pressure on parents and allow them to spend more time with their children. They will be able to let you know what they would find most useful and supportive at this time."]

let aboutNeonatalCare1:[String]! = ["youAndYourBaby1", "There are different levels of care within the NHS. Your baby will be admitted to the level that is most appropriate, depending on their needs.", "Level 1 Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU)", "is for babies who need continuous monitoring of their breathing or heart rate, additional oxygen tube feeding, phototherapy recovery (to treat neonatal jaundice) and convalescence from other care.", "Level 2 Local Neonatal Unit (LNU)", "is for babies needing short-term intensive care with apnoeic attacks who require support, including receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Some babies receiving parenteral nutrition (tube feeding) may also need this level of care.", "Level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)", "is for babies needing respiratory support (ventilation) weighing less than 1,000g, born at less than 28 weeks gestation and needing significant CPAP support (continuous positive airway pressure). Babies with severe respiratory disease who also require surgery may need this level of care too.\nIn addition to the three levels of care with neonatal units, there is a fourth level, transitional care.", "Transitional Care", "This level of care means your baby still has some needs but is almost ready to go home. Most importantly, the mum becomes the main carer with support from a nursery nurse or other staff on the unit."]
let aboutNeonatalCare2:[String]! = ["youAndYourBaby2", "The team provides care for your baby 24/7. You won’t always see the same people every day because the team works on a rota. The people you are likely to see include:\n •Neonatal nurses, who spend the most time caring for your baby.\n •The nurse in charge of the neonatal unit, usually called the nurse manager or the ward manager.\n •The consultant - the senior doctor in charge of your baby’s medical care. His or her team of junior doctors includes registrars and senior house officers (SHOs).\n •Sometimes other specialist doctors, such as a surgeon, will also be involved in your baby’s treatment.\n •Depending on your baby’s individual needs, other professionals may also help with their care, including physiotherapists, radiographers, pharmacists and dieticians.\n •Social workers, who may not be based at the hospital, can help you with practical things like claiming benefits and your rights at work.\nEvery hospital has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). This can give you information about the hospital and your rights. The service is confidential and can also help if you have a complaint or a problem that you can’t sort out yourself with the neonatal team.\nIf in doubt, just ask."]

If you are unsure, please ask the staff to explain why the equipment is being used. You can also consult the Bliss Family Handbook for further information."]
let aboutNeonatalCare4:[String]! = ["youAndYourBaby4", "Hopefully your local hospital will be able to care for your baby throughout the duration of his or her stay. However, in the UK, neonatal care is provided at four different levels and your baby may need to be transferred to another unit that has a level of care that is most appropriate to his or her needs at the time.\nTransferring your baby to another unit can be very stressful, and you will probably have questions about how the transfer will be done. This section of the website aims to provide you with general information, as guidelines differ from region to region.\nIf your baby is transferred to a different unit, you can be confident that he or she will be safe during the transfer, and that all units will provide excellent care. Once your baby is stable, and if a cot is available, every effort will be made to transfer your baby back to your local hospital.", "What is an in utero transfer?", "If you are pregnant and experience a complication, you will probably first go to your local hospital.\nYour local unit will transfer you to another unit if:\n •the mother, fetus or neonate requires enhanced care.\n •the neonatal unit is closed.\n •no neonatal cot of the appropriate level of care is available.\n •there is a request from the neonatal team or delivery suite regarding staffing or workload ratio.\nBefore nthe transfer, obstetric and neonatal staff will provide counselling to the mother. Mothers are required to give formal consent to being transferred.\nThe referring unit is responsible for safe, efficient and rapid transfer. The mother will be transferred by ambulance and will be accompanied by an experienced midwife. If, during the transfer, delivery appears imminent, the ambulance will take the mother to the nearest hospital with maternity facilities.\nThe receiving unit should clarify any ongoing care plans as soon as is practical after the mother has been transferred. The mother will then become a patient at the new unit until she has either been discharged, or transferred back to her local unit.", "How will my baby be transferred?", "Your baby will be transferred by ambulance in a specialised incubator that will maintain their temperature and oxygen levels. This allows for any required medicine to be administered during the transfer.\nThe transfer is led by a dedicated transfer team that has been specially trained to transport babies from one neonatal unit to another when necessary. They care for the baby throughout the journey and ensure the smooth running of the transport.\nYour baby will be assessed in the current unit, and will only be referred to the transfer team when s/he is fully stable. Once your baby arrives at the new hospital, the transfer team will do an official handover of information. Handover of information will include the notes and information about care and medication given to date.","Will my baby be safe during the transfer?","Yes! The transport team will only move the baby from the referring hospital when they are satisfied that the baby is stable enough for the journey. The journey is usually rapid and safe.\nOn arrival, the team will formally hand over the care of the baby to the receiving hospital.","Will I also be transferred so I can stay with my baby?", "Hospitals will always try to care for both mother and baby in the same location. However, if the mother is an inpatient at her local hospital, she will probably stay at the hospital until she is well enough to make the journey and there is a bed available. This transfer may be arranged separately.", "What is a ‘back transfer’?", "A back transfer is simply transferring your baby back to your local unit. For practical reasons (visiting, breastfeeding), it is usually best if your baby is cared for close to your home. Once your baby is stable, and if a cot is available, your unit will make every effort to transfer your baby back to your local unit. This transfer may also be recommended if your baby is recovering well, responding positively to treatment, and no longer requires specialist neonatal care.", "Can I travel with my baby in the ambulance?", "Generally, it is not recommended that parents travel in the back of the transport ambulance. The hospital will provide you with information about the new unit, including detailed directions to help you get to the new unit. It is suggested that the parents do not attempt to follow the ambulance as it may be travelling at speed.","Who will accompany my baby when he or she is taken back to my local hospital?", "At the time of transfer to your local hospital, a doctor and nurse will accompany your baby in the ambulance if ventilation support is required. If your baby is stable but does not require ventilation support, your baby will be accompanied by the transport nurse alone. Even though your baby is now stable, for safety reasons, parents do not typically accompany their baby in the ambulance."]
let visitingYourBaby1:[String]! = ["youAndYourBaby1", "It is normal for parents of special care babies to have lots of questions about their child and the neonatal unit. Each unit will work slightly differently, but there are some standard policies that will apply wherever you have been admitted.", "I’ve got a cold. Is it OK to visit my baby in hospital?", "Different neonatal units will give you different advice on this. It is always essential to practice good hygiene, such as hand washing on arrival at the unit, to avoid passing on any viruses or germs.\nAs parents, your role in supporting your baby is essential. A decision to stay away or to be with your baby should be well thought out between you and the medical staff in the light of your baby’s current health.\nThe thought of this may seem unbearable, but if you do decide to stay away, look after yourself and you will have even more to offer your baby when you return.", "My baby is in hospital and looks so fragile and different from other babies that I’m afraid to touch him/her. Is this normal?", "It’s normal for you to feel this way. It will help you and your baby if you get to know each other. Your voice may already be familiar from when your baby was in the womb and your smell is unique. While the staff may be trying to handle your baby as little as possible to avoid over-stimulation, it’s good for you to spend some time talking to and touching your baby.", "What can I do to get to know my baby better?", "Positive touch is a way of communicating your love and reassurance to your baby and hearing your baby’s needs in return. Babies do communicate. By watching and listening to your baby, you can learn what kind of touch to use and when it is appropriate, safe and pleasurable for your baby. To start with you may find it much easier to recognise when your baby is over-stimulated or distressed. In time you will get to know your baby’s individual ways and your baby may respond to you more often.\nThere are several ways to give your baby an experience of positive touch. Still and containment holding is the most appropriate for very young or highly sensitive babies. Kangaroo care and baby massage may, in time, become appropriate.", "When will my baby be able to come home?", "This will vary for each individual baby. It depends on your baby’s birth weight and gestation as well as their medical condition at birth and throughout their stay in special care. As a very rough guide, most babies do not come home until they have reached their expected due date.","Taking part in daily cares", "As soon as your baby is well enough, it is ideal if you start to look after their daily needs, just like any parent with a new baby. This helps you and your baby get to know each other and it helps to build your confidence.\nThe nurses will show you how to manage everyday tasks, which they might refer to you as your baby’s ‘cares’. You may feel all fingers and thumbs to start with, but don’t worry – practice makes perfect.","Mouth care","Cleaning your baby’s face and mouth can help you get involved in your baby’s care very early on. Try to do this when your baby appears to be awake and comfortable.\nIf you have expressed some breast milk, dip a cotton bud into the milk and clean your baby’s mouth very slowly, with a gentle press-and-scoop action to the lips. If your baby looks interested in the taste, let them suck on the cotton bud. You can use sterile water for your baby’s mouth care too.","Nappy changing", "At first you may want to watch the nurse change your baby’s nappy, and then gradually master it yourself, one step at a time. When you are ready to get involved, ask the nurse if you can take a first step by finishing off the nappy change, just fixing the clean nappy in place and settling your baby afterwards. Then as you feel more confident, take the process further each time.", "Bathing","To start with, the nurses may advise against washing your baby. The concern is that washing could cool your baby down, which is something to avoid. The little flakes of dried-on blood and waxy ‘vernix’ (the white substance that coats the skin of newborn babies) will do no harm and are best left where they are.\nSome very small babies find a first bath less stressful if they are wrapped up (swaddled). Ask the nurse if this is something they do on your baby’s unit. You should be able to give your baby their first bath, with help from the nurse. It can be very daunting at first, but it won’t take long before you are confident."]

As your baby’s parents, you are the best people to balance this with a positive, reassuring touch.\nPositive touch is a way of communicating your love and reassurance to your baby and hearing your baby’s needs in return. Babies do communicate, and by watching and listening to your baby you can learn what kind of touch to use and when it is appropriate, safe and pleasurable for your baby.\nIt’s harder for your baby to communicate when exposed to too much noise, too much light, too much cool air, or an uncomfortable lying position. See whether the environment can be calmed down first. In time, you will get to know your baby’s individual ways and you may find your baby responding more often and for longer.","Comfort holding","Comfort holding is one of many ways for you and your baby to get to know each other. Your baby may be more comfortable lying in the incubator than being held. In this case, the staff may suggest that you try comfort holding if they think your baby is well enough. Comfort holding is ‘still touch’. Cradling your baby with still, resting hands can be more comforting than stroking or massage, which are more stimulating.\nComfort holding can:\n •soothe your baby during uncomfortable procedures.\n •settle a restless baby.\n •help your baby to get back to sleep after feeds and care.\n •encourage your baby to be quietly awake and responsive.\nComfort holding is a way to experience loving touch when your baby is not ready to be held.\nTalk to your baby’s nurse about comfort holding.Together you can watch for signs from your baby that will guide you as to when and how to do it.\nBe careful to:\n •Remove watches and jewellery, pull your sleeves up to the elbows, and wash your hands and lower arms. This reduces the risk of infection inside the incubator.\n •Always make sure that your hands are warm before touching your baby.\n •If your baby has difficulty keeping warm, make sure there is a layer of fabric (a hat, vest or blanket) between you.\n •Speak to your baby before touching, so that they are aware of your presence before you start.\n •Cradle one or both hands around your baby’s feet, head or body, and keep them still. Your baby may also like to grasp one of your fingers.\n •Wait and watch for signs that tell you that your baby is relaxed. \nYou can continue for as long as you are both comfortable. When you finish comfort holding, move your hands away from your baby very slowly.","Kangaroo Care","Kangaroo Care is skin-to-skin contact when a baby is placed against the parent’s chest. Benefits include improvements with lactation and with establishing breastfeeding, and better weight gain for the baby. In the longer term, it helps parents to feel closer to their babies and more confident in caring for them. Kangaroo Care can be used with babies with high medical needs, but this will require careful planning and collaboration with the neonatal staff.\nTalk to staff and plan a good time and comfortable place for you to try Kangaroo Care.\nWhile Kangaroo Care is based on direct skin-to-skin contact, removing your baby’s clothes is not vital if this is upsetting for him or her. A hat and a blanket for extra warmth might be necessary for very small babies.\nHold your baby chest-to-chest tucked inside your clothes, enclosing him/her to keep his/her temperature stable. Check that the head is well supported and if you can’t see your baby easily, try using a hand mirror.\nExplore what you both like to enjoy together. Some babies like to have their eyes shielded, others like to be sung to softly or while having a tube feed. Allow time for your baby to settle and get the full benefit.\nIf you baby is happy, you can cuddle for as long as you are both comfortable. Lie back, relax and enjoy."]

This is why a tube is passed through their noses or mouths and down into their stomachs. This is called tube feeding.\nThere are two types of tube feeding used:\n •Nasogastric tube feeding - This is when a baby is fed through a small soft tube, which is placed in the nose and runs down the back of the throat, through the food pipe (oesophagus) and into the stomach.\n •Orogastric tube feeding - This is when a baby is fed through a small soft tube, which is placed in the mouth and runs down the back of the throat, through the food pipe (oesophagus) and into the stomach.\nYou may notice your baby opening and closing his/her mouth, putting out his/her tongue or sucking fingers during a tube feed. This shows that he/she is ready to practise sucking.\nIf your baby is well enough to come out of the incubator, give him/her lots of opportunities to be at your breast so he/she can enjoy being close.

These may include feed thickeners, which are added to the baby’s milk to help reduce the effect of reflux. Thickeners work by making the feed more solid once it is in the stomach and this makes it harder to bring back up. Infant Gaviscon is an example of this. Other medications may help to lower the acid production in the stomach and to speed up food passage through the stomach.\nReflux is often worse when a baby is lying flat on their back, so it can help if you keep your baby’s head gently raised during the day. The most important time is after a feed; at this time you should hold your baby upright for as long as you can.\nIf your baby suffers from reflux during the night, try making the head end of the cot slightly higher by standing it on something stable (a couple of books perhaps), so that your baby’s head is slightly raised. However, you should not put anything directly under your baby’s head, and never use a pillow with a baby under 12 months old.\nMost babies will grow out of reflux naturally.

To decide if your baby is ready to go home, they will assess if your baby is able to control their temperature, how well they are feeding and if their cares can be continued outside of the unit, without constant professional support. If your baby still has certain feeding or breathing difficulties or requires specialist attention, they may well still be able to go home, but only once you have been given enough information on how to look after your baby confidently and follow-up support has been arranged.\nIt is also very important that you feel it is the right time to bring your baby home too. You may well have questions or concerns, so make sure you discuss them with the staff or discharge team.", "Will my baby have to stay in hospital until they reach their due date?", "Not always. In your discharge planning meeting, which should take place in what would have been week 33/34 of pregnancy, you will meet the multi-disciplinary team and they will assess your baby’s progress. If your baby is feeding well, gaining weight and has no other problems, they may be well enough to go home before their original due date.", "What if my baby is on medication or is very small when I am told they can go home?", "The staff on the unit wouldn’t discharge your baby if they thought it was unsafe. Even though some babies may still have ongoing medical issues, these issues will be ones that staff are sure you are able to cope with at home. You will have access to advice and support if you need it, and staff will explain to you all you need to know to become the main carers of your baby.", "I have twins - what if one baby is ready to go home before the other?", "When you have twins or triplets, it sometimes happens that one of the babies will be ready for discharge before the other/s. This can be very difficult for parents, both on an emotional and practical level, with visiting and caring for two or more babies in different places. Your babies will only be separated if there is likely to be a long period between them being ready for discharge; if it’s a matter of a few days, it would be reasonable to expect them to come home at the same time.", "Will my baby's development be the same as for a baby of the same corrected age?", "Your baby’s prematurity will be taken into account when looking at their development. However, this does not necessarily mean that your baby will be at exactly the same stage of development in all areas as babies of the same corrected age. Like term babies, premature babies will have their own individual pace and abilities, which may be faster or slower.\nFor certain things, such as immunisations, your baby’s age will be worked out according to their actual birth date, not their corrected age."]
