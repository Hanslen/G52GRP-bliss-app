Medical conditions and procedures

Premature and low birth weight babies have little ability to fight infection and 
this is a common problem that needs treatment.

Sometimes infections are caused by germs collecting on long lines, which may need to be removed, 
or on ventilation tubing in the windpipe. As a result, infection is a common problem; 
however not all infections are the same and not all of them are severe.

This section explains some different types of infections and other medical conditions 
as well as common tests and procedures that your baby may need.
