Multiple births

Babies in a multiple pregnancy are much more likely to experience some level of additional care 
in hospital after birth, known as ‘special’ or ‘neonatal’ care.

Sometimes one baby may be admitted to the neonatal unit, or transferred to another, while the other baby or babies 
are able to stay in the maternity unit. It is perfectly natural in this situation to give your attention to the baby 
you are able to care for. This situation can create problems with visiting and establishing routines and it is normal to feel torn. 
The staff should be able to support you in juggling your babies’ needs and provide the help you need to bond with them.

It may also be necessary to transfer you to a different hospital whilst you are pregnant, during labour or after delivery. 
This occurs if your local unit does not have spare cots, sufficient staff resources or cannot provide the level of care needed. 
It is important for families to be fully informed of their rights and choices. You can find out more information about transfers (LINK)here(LINK).

The (LINK)Twins and Multiple Births Association(LINK) (Tamba) in conjunction with Bliss have produced a guide to help prepare and support multiple birth parents, 
Multiple births – A parent’s guide to neonatal care. You can order or download this publication from our (LINK)online shop.(LINK)
