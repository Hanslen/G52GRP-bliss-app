If your baby is unwell

The change in atmosphere, drier heat and more dust at home compared with the unit 
may make some babies more snuffly. Don’t worry, particularly if your baby seems well 
and is able to feed. The snuffling will settle down, but this may take a few weeks. 
Check your baby’s temperature if you think he or she might be unwell; if it is lower 
or higher than normal, or if your baby is struggling to keep warm, ask your GP or health 
visitor for advice.

Check whether your baby is becoming unwell:

-Are they more fretful than usual?

-Do they have a raised or lower temperature?

-Are they not interested in/reluctant to feed?

-Have they been vomiting, more than usual?

-Has there been a change in stools – more frequent, watery or ‘explosive’ than usual?

-Are they less aware of you (not as responsive, not waking up as easily, more ‘floppy’, 
breathing more rapid and noisy)?

-Do they have blotchy skin or a rash that doesn’t become much lighter when a glass 
tumbler is pressed against it? Are they pausing for a few seconds between breaths 
and paler than usual? These two options could possibly be serious, and you should get 
medical advice urgently.

-Make sure you have details of the nearest A&E with children’s services.

-How can I protect my baby from the risk of infection?

-If your baby was ventilated, needed oxygen or was very premature, he or she may be 
more at risk from infections that affect breathing. It is not possible to completely 
protect your baby, but there are steps you can take.

-If you are worried that your baby is unwell, seek medical advice.
