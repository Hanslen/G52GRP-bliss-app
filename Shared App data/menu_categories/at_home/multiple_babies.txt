Multiple babies

It is quite common for one baby to be ready to go home from the hospital before the other/s. 
This can be a confusing time for parents of multiples as it can be traumatic to 
leave a baby behind. It is crucial for you to continue bonding with the babies 
or baby that remains in hospital; this is best achieved by (LINK)skin-to-skin(LINK) 
contact when you are visiting. You may like to leave a photo near the baby’s cot, 
and also take one home for the remaining family members.

It can sometimes feel like favouritism to be spending time with the baby at home, 
but it’s important to remember that you will soon be able to have your 
babies together again. Treating twins and multiples as individuals is 
good for their long term development.

Sleep time and safe sleeping

Many multiples share a cot initially and research suggests that these babies tend to 
develop similar sleeping patterns, not waking any more often than babies who sleep apart. 
This research also suggests that cot-sharing twins have not been linked to an increased 
risk of cot death or SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).

Babies should sleep on their backs, with their feet to a firm base to stop them wriggling 
under covers, covered with separate blankets. Most newborn twins/triplets/multiples start 
off by sleeping side by side at the foot of the cot. As the babies get larger they may 
stay in this position or sleep head to head. These both comply with the ‘feet to the 
foot of the cot’ recommendation aimed at reducing sudden infant death syndrome.
