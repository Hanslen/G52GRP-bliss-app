Settling in at home

It is extremely common for parents of special care babies to feel nervous and unsure 
about being able to cope. The transition from hospital to home is a big step for you, 
your baby and the whole family. It is often a time of mixed emotions. 
It takes time, but gradually you will learn what you need to do. 

If you find that you do not feel confident about caring for your baby at home, 
remember that help is at hand. You can speak to your health visitor or your 
community neonatal nurse and explain to them how you are feeling - often some practical, 
objective advice is all you need. You may also be able to see a counsellor or a 
psychotherapist through the unit that discharged you. 
Contact your unit for more information.

Alternatively, call the Bliss freephone Helpline on 0500 618 140, 
and an advisor will be able to help. The line is open from 9am to 9pm, 
Monday to Friday. You can also email us at:
