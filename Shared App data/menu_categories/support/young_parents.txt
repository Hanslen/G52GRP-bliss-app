Young parents

Are you a young parent?

Bliss is here to support all parents of premature or sick babies. 
Many young parents tell us that they would welcome talking to somebody during 
this difficult time, but don’t realise that support is available. 
Bliss is here to help you through it. We offer all parents a wide range of free 
support and information, as well as face-to-face services via neonatal unit volunteers 
and family groups, where you can meet and chat with other parents who have been through 
a similar situation.
 
If you would like free, confidential support, call the Bliss helpline on 
(PHONE)0500 618 140(PHONE), email (EMAIL)hello@bliss.org.uk(EMAIL) or find support 
in your area (LINK)here(LINK)
 
Would you like to share your story with Bliss?
 
If you are a young parent under 20 and would like to share your experience, 
in order to raise awareness and give hope to other parents, please email 
(EMAIL)hannahc@bliss.org.uk(EMAIL) for more information.
