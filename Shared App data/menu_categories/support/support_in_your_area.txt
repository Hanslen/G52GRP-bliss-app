Support in your area

The Bliss network of local Family Groups, Buddies and Champions provides help and support 
to families throughout the UK with a premature or sick baby. The support network provides 
everything from one-to-one support, to group meetings, social events, family fun days and 
fundraising.

Bliss Family Groups provide a local network for parents and families of premature and sick 
babies. They are run by volunteers (often parents, relatives, friends and healthcare 
professionals) who have had experience of special care and can provide practical and 
emotional support to families. The group provides a network for parents and other 
relatives to socialise, get advice, share information and provide mutual support. 
Groups also undertake fundraising and other activities on behalf of Bliss as part of 
their programme of events.

Bliss Champions provide a vital link between parents, neonatal units and Bliss services, 
to ensure that families can gain access to the information and support services that we 
provide. Bliss aims to ensure that all families with a baby on a neonatal unit for more 
than 24 hours have access to our resources and support.
