Before you leave

As well as getting to know your baby, it is important to make sure you are completely confident 
with providing your baby’s care. For example:

-Do you know how to make your baby comfortable and reassured?

-Do you know how to give your baby a bath?

-Have you been shown how to give your baby medication?

-Have you been shown how to use any specialist equipment?

-If you are expressing or bottle feeding, do you know how to sterilise bottles and 
 make up - your baby’s feeds?

-Have you received resuscitation training?

-Do you know how to monitor and control temperature?

-Are you aware of techniques to prevent cot death?

-Do you have enough information and support to breastfeed?

If you don’t feel sure about any aspect of your baby’s care, ask staff on the unit – 
they will be happy to help you.
