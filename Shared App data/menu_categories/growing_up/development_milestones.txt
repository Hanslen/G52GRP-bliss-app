Development milestones

Reaching developmental milestones may take longer in premature babies and it is 
likely that they will reach major milestones later than babies born full term. 
This is because they are in fact younger and your baby should be assessed according 
to their corrected age. This is the age they are from their term due date. Your baby’s 
development will be regularly assessed and monitored by their healthcare professional. 
This should reassure you that your baby is doing well and also address any concerns 
you may have.

Some babies may need extra support from a physiotherapist or occupational therapist 
to help develop their strength and muscle tone. Your baby may be given some gentle 
exercises or activities for you to help them achieve this. If you have any concerns 
about your baby’s development, then you should discuss this with your healthcare 
professional.
