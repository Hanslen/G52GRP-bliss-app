Advice for families with a disabled child

Babies who are born premature or sick sometimes start life with a disability. 
In this section you will find information about the help and benefits that are 
available for families with a disabled child.

Think carefully about whether this could apply to your child. 
For example, if he/she went home on oxygen, he/she would be classed as disabled. 
Make sure you also read our (LINK)section on financial advice for families(LINK). 
If your child is disabled, you may get some of the benefits listed there at a higher rate. 
It’s important to apply straight away if you think you are entitled to a benefit - 
delaying may mean you miss out on benefits which you're entitled to.

The benefits system is complicated, especially if you are claiming for a disabled child. 
It’s advisable to seek independent expert advice on this matter.

Hospital staff or the (LINK)Patient Advice and Liaison Service(LINK) (PALS)
might know about other people who can help you claim benefits. If your baby has a disability, 
ask the hospital team if they can refer you to a social worker who can help you claim 
benefits. A social worker can also help you get the care and education your child will 
need over the longer term.

The charity (LINK)Contact a Family(LINK) provides support to all families with disabled 
children. It puts families in touch with one another for mutual support. 
It can also refer you to other charities that specialise in your child’s specific 
disability or health condition, if this would be helpful to you. 
Contact a Family can provide information about medical conditions, claiming benefits, 
social services, education and your family’s rights.

The (LINK)Citizens Advice Bureau(LINK) is another good place to go for advice about 
disability rights and benefits. Your council (local authority) should also be able to 
advise you about benefits for disabled people.
